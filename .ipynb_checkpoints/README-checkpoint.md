# PyBer_Analysis
##Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze ride-sharing data for each city type. We also graphed the fares on a line chart to compare them across all city types.

##Results
The bigger the city, the lower the average cost of the ride. The bigger the city, the higher the total amount of rides, translating to a higher amount of revenue from fares. Urban city rides had a toal of 1,625 rides, Suburban cities had 625 rides and Rurual cities had a measley 125 rides. 


##Summary
1. Urban cities fares were the highest, providing a possible opportuinty for expanded drivers to generage business. 
2. Rural cities had the highest rates of fares per driver. We can add some drivers to rural cities to drive the price down for driver fares.
3. We can grow the business out most in Suburban cities by increasing the total number of drivers.
